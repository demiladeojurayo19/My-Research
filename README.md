**Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications**

**Overview**

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The project includes a comprehensive Python script for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a Power BI dashboard for visualizing the results.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:

datasets/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
notebook/: Contains a Jupyter notebook that includes code for data cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning model implementation, evaluation, and generating output files.
dashboard/: Files related to the dashboards built in Power BI, showcasing both the descriptive analysis of the dataset and the performance evaluation of the machine learning models.
README.md: Documentation and instructions for the project.

**Requirements**
To run the code and reproduce the results, the following libraries and tools are required:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
Power BI (for dashboard creation and visualization)

  **Datasets**
The primary dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a fictional telecommunications company based in California. It includes 7,043 records and 50 attributes covering customer demographics, service usage patterns, billing information, and churn indicators. The dataset is available for download via this link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfathterry/telco-customer-churn-11-1-3/data.

**Dashboards**
**Dashboard 1: Descriptive Analysis**
This dashboard provides an overview of the dataset, including key descriptive statistics and visualizations. It helps to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, such as demographic factors, and churn reasons.

**Dashboard 2: Model Performance Evaluation**
This dashboard showcases the performance evaluation metrics of the three machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are visualized, allowing for an easy comparison of model effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
